= How to install docToolchain

include::../_feedback.adoc[]

== Get the Wrapper

The basic strategy on how to install docToolchain has changed with V2.x.
You now install a small wrapper scripts to your project which does the rest for you:

.Linux / WSL2 with bash
[role='primary']
--
[source, bash]
----
cd <your project>
wget doctoolchain.github.io/dtcw
chmod +x dtcw
----

if you don't have `wget` installed, you can also use `curl`:
[source, bash]
----
cd <your project>
curl -Lo dtcw doctoolchain.github.io/dtcw
chmod +x dtcw
----

--

.Windows with Powershell
[role='secondary']
--
[source, powershell]
----
cd <your project>
wget doctoolchain.github.io/dtcw.ps1 -Outfile dtcw.ps1
----
--

.Windows with cmd.exe
[role='secondary']
--
[source, cmd]
----
cd <your project>
curl -Lo dtcw.bat doctoolchain.github.io/dtcw.bat
----

NOTE: `dtcw.bat` wraps the `dtcw.ps1` script and executes it in powershell. This might be easier to use if you haven't yet configured your powershell as a developer.

--

NOTE: In order to support development for your project on both, Linux and Windows, it makes sense to download all three scripts to your project.

NOTE: if you use `cmd.exe`, please follow the instructions for powershell in the manual. We will not further differentiate between both.

IMPORTANT: `dtcw` uses bash as shell and thus tries to find java from within bash. Chances are that when you use `dtcw` from another shell like zsh, you shell knows about the right java version but your bash doesn't. In that case, please switch to bash and make sure that the right java version is known. Afterwards, you can switch back to your shell.

The wrapper helps you in several ways:

- it ensures that everyone who uses your repository, uses the same version of docToolchain
- it keeps all the technology out of your repository
- it wraps all your commands and directs them to your local docToolchain installation
- even more, it checks the way you have docToolchain installed and if it hasn't been installed, it will install it for you via direct download or docker

== run a first command

To get started, you can run `tasks` as a first command:

.Linux / WSL2 with bash
[role='primary']
--
[source, bash]
----
./dtcw tasks --group=doctoolchain
----
--

.Windows with Powershell
[role='secondary']
--
[source, powershell]
----
./dtcw.ps1 tasks --group=doctoolchain
----
--

This command will show you all tasks available through docToolchain, but first it will make sure that docToolchain is installed:

* it checks for a configuration file and creates a default one if none is available.
* it prefers a local installation
* if docker is available and no local installation, it will use docker. The download of the images might take a while when run for the first time
* if docker is not available, it will download and install docToolchain to your home folder
** it will then run a gradle build through the gradle wrapper. This will download and install gradle when run for the first time.
** the gradle build will also fetch some dependencies. This will also take some time when run for the first time.

As you can see, the installation is an incremental process and will take some time because of additional downloads.
After the first few commands, you will have all the needed dependencies installed and things will be faster.

//end::install[]

== Existing documents

If you already have some existing documents in AsciiDoc format in your project, you need to tell docToolchain where it can find these documents.
To do so, take a look at the created `docToolchainConfig.groovy` and update it.

== arc42 from scratch

If you don't have existing documents yet, or if you need a fresh start, you can get the https://arc42.org[arc42] template in AsciiDoc format.

Run the following command to ask docToolchain to download the template of your choice:

.Linux / WSL2 with bash
[.primary]
--
[source,bash]
----
./dtcw downloadTemplate
----
--

.Windows
[.secondary]
--
[source,powershell]
----
./dtcw.ps1 downloadTemplate
----
--

== Build

By now, docToolchain is installed as command line tool and the path to its `bin` folder should be on your path, the docToolchain wrapper `dtcw` resides in your project folder and the arc42 template is installed.
Now let's render it as HTML and PDF.

If you now switch to your freshly initialized <newDocDir>, you should be able to execute the following commands:

.Linux / WSL2 with bash
[source,bash]
----
doctoolchain <docDir> generateHTML
doctoolchain <docDir> generatePDF
----

.Windows
[source]
----
doctoolchain.bat <docDir> generateHTML
doctoolchain.bat <docDir> generatePDF
----

<docDir> may be relative, e.g. ".", or absolute.

As a result, you will see the progress of your build together with some warnings which you can just ignore for the moment.

The first build generated some files within the `<docDir>/build`:

[source]
----
build
|-- html5
|   |-- arc42-template.html
|   `-- images
|       |-- 05_building_blocks-EN.png
|       |-- 08-Crosscutting-Concepts-Structure-EN.png
|       `-- arc42-logo.png
`-- pdf
    |-- arc42-template.pdf
    `-- images
        |-- 05_building_blocks-EN.png
        |-- 08-Crosscutting-Concepts-Structure-EN.png
        `-- arc42-logo.png
----

*Congratulations!* If you see the same folder structure, you just managed to render the standard arc42 template as html and pdf!
