[[html_out]]
.generated output of generateHTML task
image::generateHTML.dio.png[]

As you can see in <<html_out>>, the HTML output is rendered as a single page with a table of contents (TOC) on the left.
If you have chosen the `withhelp` version, you will notice some little question marks on the right.
Hover over these with your mouse and you will see the full help text for each paragraph.
This way, you can leave these help texts in your docs without annoying your readers.

[[pdf_out]]
.generated output of generatePDF task
image::generatePDF.png[]

<<pdf_out>> shows you the generated PDF.
It also contains a TOC on the first pages and your PDF reader will also show the TOC on the left for you to navigate through the document.

Both, the HTML and PDF output can be styled to fit your needs.
