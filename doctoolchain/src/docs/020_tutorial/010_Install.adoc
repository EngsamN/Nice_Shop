=== Problems & Solutions

==== dtcw does not run

When you get an error similiar to this one...

[source]
----
./dtcw local tasks --group=doctoolchain
./dtcw: line 1: syntax error near unexpected token `newline'
./dtcw: line 1: `<!DOCTYPE html>'
----

it is likely that the download of the wrapper didn't work.
Your will see that an HTML page has been downloaded instead of the wrapper.
Please try to re-download it.

==== wrong java version

When docToolchain starts but crashes with a stacktrace that starts like this...

[source]
----
* What went wrong:
Could not compile settings file '/Users/falk/.doctoolchain/docToolchain-2.0.0/settings.gradle'.
> startup failed:
  General error during semantic analysis: Unsupported class file major version 61
  
  java.lang.IllegalArgumentException: Unsupported class file major version 61
----  

then you've got a wrong java version.
dtcw tries to check the java version upfront by doing a  `java --version` but gradle sometimes picks up a different version.
In that case, please try to re-install a correct java version.
