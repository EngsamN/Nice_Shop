When you use the build in static site generator through <<task_generatesite>>, you sometimes need a real static server locally running to preview the results.

This task will start a jetty with your generated site.

NOTE: When you use WSL to execute this command, you will need the IP V6 address of localhost `[::1]` to access the server.
`127.0.0.1` or `localhost` will not work.

NOTE: Most site themes don't need the static site server for general content.
You can just preview the site by opening it right from the filesystem in your browser.
But some javascript features will not work because of CORS restrictions.
