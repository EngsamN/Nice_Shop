When you have _one_ document, the output of `generateHTML` might fit your needs.
When your documentation grows, and you have _several_ documents, you need a microsite which bundles all the information.

The `generateSite` task uses https://jbake.org[jBake] to create a static site with a Landingpage, Blog and Search.

== Pages

The microsite is page oriented instead of document oriented.
It is likely that you already organized your documents by chapter.
Use these chapters as pages to create a great user experience.

The arc42-template sources are a good example.

In order to include a page in the microsite, add a meta-data header to it.

.page meta-data
[source, asciidoc]
----
:jbake-menu: arc42
:jbake-title: Solution Strategy
:jbake-order: 4
:jbake-type: page_toc
:jbake-status: published
:filename: 015_tasks/03_task_generateSite.adoc
ifndef::immagesdir[:imagesdir: ../../images]

:toc:

[[section-solution-strategy]]
== Solution Strategy
----

jbake-menu:: the top-level menu for this page.
Defaults to the top-level folder name of the adoc file within the `docDir`.
jbake-title:: the title to be displayed in the drop-down top-level menu.
Defaults to the first headline of the file.
jbake-order:: give the drop-down entries a sort order.
Defaults to a prefixed number of the file like `**04**_filename.adoc` or to the prefixed number of the second level folder name.
jbake-type:: the page type.
This controls which template is used to render the page.
You will mostly use `page` for a full-width page or `page_toc` for a page with a table of contents (toc) rendered on the left.
Defaults to `page_toc`.
jbake-status:: `draft` or `published`.
Only `published` pages will be rendered.
Defaults to `published` for files with a `jbake-order` and `draft` for files without order or files prefixed with `_`.
filename:: needed for edit and feedback-links (coming soon).
Defaults to the filename :-)
ifndef:: this fixes the imagesdir according to the nesting level of your docs folder
Defaults to the main `docDir/images`
toc:: for `:jbake-type: page_toc`, you need this line to generate the toc.

NOTE: Start your pages with a `==` level headline. You can fix the level offset when you include the page in a larger document with `include::chapter.adoc[leveloffset=+1]`

== Templates and Style

The jBake templates and CSS etc. is hidden away from you for convenience.
The basic template use http://getbootstrap.com/[twitter Bootstrap 5] as CSS framework.

Use the <<task-copyThemes,`copyThemes`>> task to copy all hidden jBake resources to your project.
You can then remove the ones you don't need and change those you want to change.

NOTE: `copyThemes` overwrites existing files, but your code is under version control, isn't it?

== Landing Page

Put a `index.gsp` page as landing page in `src/site/templates`.
This landing page is plain HTML5 styled with twitter bootstrap.
Header and footer is added by docToolchain.
An example can be found through <<task-copyThemes,`copyThemes`>> or https://github.com/docToolchain/docToolchain/blob/ng/src/site/templates/index.gsp[on github].

== Blog

The microsite also contains a simple but powerful blog.
Use it to inform your team about changes and architecture decision records (ADRs).

To create a new blog post, create a new file in `src/docs/blog/<year>/<post-name>.adoc` with the following template:

.blog post template
[source, asciidoc]
----
:jbake-title: <title-of your post>
:jbake-date: <date formatted as 2021-02-28>
:jbake-type: post
:jbake-tags: <blog, asciidoc>
:jbake-status: published

:imagesdir: ../../images

= {jbake-title}
{jbake-author}
{jbake-date}

<insert your text here>

----

== Search

The microsite does not bring its own local search.
Instead, it only has a search input-field which can be used to link to another search engine.

== CI/CD

When run in an automated build, you should set the environment variable `DTC_HEADLESS` to `true` or `1` to ensure that docToolchain will not ask to install the configured theme.
It will simply assume that you do want to install it.

To avoid the download of the theme with every build, you can copy the themes folder from `$HOME/.doctoolchain/themes` to the corresponding folder in your build container.
