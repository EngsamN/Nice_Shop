This task makes use of the https://github.com/asciidoctor/asciidoctor-reveal.js/[asciidoctor-reveal.js] backend to render your documents into a HTML based presentation.

This task is best used together with the <<exportPPT>> task.
It creates a PowerPoint presentation and enriches it with reveal.js slide definitions in AsciiDoc within the speaker notes.
