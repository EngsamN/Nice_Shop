== Setup Development Environment

include::../_feedback.adoc[]

Since v2.0, all the code is hidden from curious eyes when you install docToolchain.
To access and change the code, you first have to know some details about the inner workings.

=== local install, docker, sdkman

Development is based on the local installation of docToolchain.
Docker simply contains a local install and sdkman install docToolchain locally, but the location is controller by sdkman and not docToolchain.
This is why you need a local installation for development.
Docker and sdkman are derived from it.

The docToolchain-Wrapper installs docToolchain locally to `$HOME/.doctoolchain/docToolchain-${VERSION}/`.

All task invokations through the docToolchain wrapper `dtcw` are redirected to `$HOME/.doctoolchain/docToolchain-${VERSION}/bin/doctoolchain`.
This is another shell script which calls the gradle wrapper for most tasks.

So create a local install which is connected to your github fork of docToolchain, create a folder called

`$HOME/.doctoolchain/docToolchain-2.0.0-dev/`

and checkout the ng-branch of your fork to this folder.

To use this version in your test project, edit the version configured at the start of your `dtcw` script to `2.0.0-dev`.

NOTE: you have now the full repository locally cloned.
To save memory, only some parts of this repository are zipped for distribution.
Check out the https://github.com/docToolchain/docToolchain/blob/master/build.gradle#L79[prepareDist-Task] if you run into problems.

=== Create Gradle independent tasks

Currently, all tasks use Gradle to run.
To make docToolchain faster, it makes sense to circumvent Gradle for tasks where it doesn't add any benefits.
To do so, you can use the `bin/doctoolchain` scripts and create a switch.

=== Create or Change a Theme

Not only the docToolchain code but also the themes for the static site generator jBake are hidden.

==== Overwrite Theme for a Project

When docToolchain builds the static website, it first copies an internal theme to a temp-folder, then copies an external theme (if defined) over it and as a last step, it copies the project theme over it.

This gives you the chance to overwrite some parts of the theme on a per project basis.
To make it easier, run the `copyThemes` task.
It will copy the internal and external theme to `microsite.siteFolder`.
You can then check those files (take a look at https://jbake.org[jbake.org] to get a better understanding), modify the ones you wish to change and delete all others.

==== Create a new Theme

An external theme is in fact just a zipped copy of the `microsite.siteFolder` as mentioned in the previous chapter.
All themes are once downloaded when referenced from a `dtcw` configuration and are stored in `$HOME/.doctoolchain/themes/[hash of url]`.

If you want to modify an existing theme, go to its folder and checkout the theme's project instead of the downloaded copy.
This will give you the connection back to the github repository and you can modify the theme directly in `$HOME/.doctoolchain/themes/[hash of url]`.

If you want to create a new theme from scratch, the hash is a simple md5 hash.
So, for example, if you configure your new theme as `"myTheme"`, then `"myTheme".md5()` will be the hash.

==== Special functionality for Themes

===== Config Fragments

It is quite likely that you need a new config item for your self generated theme.
And wouldn't it be nice if the user would be asked to set a value for this new config item when she installs the theme for the first time?

Create a file `configFragment.groovy` in the `site` folder of your theme.
Here is an example for what to put in this file:

[source, groovy]
----
// the title of the microsite, displayed in the upper left corner
// Example: my new site
title = '##site-title##'
----

The first line is some explanation displayed to the user.
You can have several lines of explanations.

The second line, starting with `Example:` is used as default value for the prompt.

The third line is the config item itself.
If the value is surrounded by `##`, the user will be prompted for this value and it will be replaced with the user's input.
Otherwise, the config item will be added without a prompt to the users current `docToochainConfig.groovy`.
