== v2.0.0 of docToolchain has been released!

Today docToolchain reached an important milestone - the release of version 2.0.0 aka ng or next-generation.

The focus of this huge release is simplified setup, better usability and distraction free writing.

=== Which new features can you expect?

The most important change is the *switch to a command-line based approach*.
You can now fully focus on your documentation without having lots of other files like scripts or themes in your repository.

This is possible through the introduction of the *docToolchain-wrapper* or short dtcw.
A little script that resides together with a config file in your repository.
It takes care to use the right version of docToolchain, all pre-requisites are met, and it even checks if it should use docker or a local installation to execute docToolchain.
If docToolchain is not installed, it will install it for you.

Another change is that we tried very hard to *avoid error messages*.
Where we can't avoid errors, we tried to convert them to helpful hints.
This should make the use of docToolchain a better experience.

Another huge added feature is the link:../../015_tasks/03_task_generateSite.html[`generateSite`]-Task which includes jBake as *static site generator* to help you even more to create awesome docs.
You can now create a full documentation website with less than a handful commands.
It uses the beautiful docsy theme known from hugo, and it even contains a link:../../search.html[*local search*] implemented with lunr.

To get you started with your solution architecture documentation, we've added the link:../../015_tasks/03_task_downloadTemplate.html[`downloadTemplate`]-task to provide you with the famous *arc42 template* in four languages.

Last but not least, we used the new link:../../015_tasks/03_task_generateSite.html[`generateSite`]-Feature to restructure the documentation of docToolchain itself.

The goal for the next weeks is now to provide you with tutorials over the next few weeks to demonstrate all new features.

IMPORTANT: Thanx to all contributors, sponsors, and users of docToolchain for your efforts!
Without you, this project would not exist ðŸ’¯

Happy writing!

Ralf
